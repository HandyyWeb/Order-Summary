<ins>My process</ins> :

Built with :

CSS custom properties
CSS Flex box
CSS Media queries
CSS Font-face rules

<ins>What I learned</ins> : 

For my third challenge, I have learned to be more comfortable with the usage of CSS units for padding, font-size, etc... / background image.
Filter CSS property ( in particular for the hover effect on the button ), used with the `brightness` function and the usage of custom css property ( for example `--very-pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%)` are the only new things that i have learned in this project, but it's better than nothing !
But above all, this is the first project in which i have included Flexbox and I'm quite proud of the result.

  
<ins>Continued develoment</ins>:

I need to be more conscientious about my usage of CSS units, in particular I need to ask me more if i want the padding or font-size to grow with the page size ( so i will use rem/em ) or if i want it to stay at a fixed length ( so i will use px ), it will come with experience.
Maybe my CSS code can be more clean, with less line of codes so i need to learn more about CSS tricks to reduce my code length ( make it more readable ).

<ins>Useful ressources</ins>:

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ : A complete guide on Flexbox, what are the property for both parent and child component, very handy and useful to understand this aspect of CSS.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter : If you want to learn more about CSS filter and his properties.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36230944/prevent-flex-items-from-overflowing-a-container : The `min-width : 0` trick explained if you want to prevent flex items from overflowing a container, very useful !
