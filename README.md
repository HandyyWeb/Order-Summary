Built with :

CSS custom properties
CSS Grid box

<ins>What I learned</ins> : 

For my third challenge, I have learned to be more comfortable with the usage of grid box / CSS units for padding, font-size, etc... / background image.

<ins>Continued develoment</ins>:

I need to continue to work on Flexbox/grid CSS and also work more on how to use units (em/rem/vh/vw/etc...)
I have also some struggles with with the layout ( maybe my padding or whatever isn't very optimal ), however, I will strive to gain experience on this in my next projects !
